									<p><strong>I have never been as certain of a career choice as I am now.</strong></p>

									<p>Raised in urban areas of Southern California - I was exposed, but sheltered from, drugs and gang culture. This sparked in me a longing to understand the reasons behind people's choices. I had an ever-present curiosity as to what we share in common - grown in an environment characterized by division.</p>
									<p>Odd jobs throughout college taught me, most of all, that I do best in a challenging environment where I can take ownership of my work. I started pursuing a (mostly) self-taught-education in programming starting in Fall 2017.</p>
									<p>Programming has given me that outlet for self-actualization and I hope also serves as an avenue to better the lives of others. Ideally, I would like to one day work in data science to harness the power of technology to make targeted efforts at improving equitable distribution of resources and empower populations and individuals to improve their situation. I have never been more eager to get back to work. Hopefully, I get to join you in work worth doing.</p>

									<h2>Background</h2>
									<p><strong>First Generation American, Original Californian, Avid Coloradan, Astrophysicist</strong></p>

									<p>I studied Psychology at Colorado State University. I ultimately left for financial reasons. I will always have a fondness for my time in academia but I am more oriented towards execution over theory nowadays and for the foreseeable future. After leaving CSU, I took two formal courses in programming (Intro to Java, Intro to Programming) at a community college and have never looked back since then.</p>
									<p>From there I taught myself programming from Feb, 2018 until Oct, 2018 (the start of Turing School). I decided to pursue a bootcamp in order to develop my proffesional and communication skillsets alongside programming. One of the better decisions of my life to say the least.</p>
